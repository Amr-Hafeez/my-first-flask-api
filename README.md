## My First Flask REST API

- First, create a virtual environment for your project
```shell

pyhton -m venv <env_folder_name>
```

- Activate the recent created `env`
```shell

source env/Scripts/activate 
```

- Use this command to install the project's dependencies
```shell

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
